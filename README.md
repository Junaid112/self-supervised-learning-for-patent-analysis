# self-supervised-learning-for-patent-analysis

This repository offers a self-supervised-learning method for patent analysis including image type and perspective type with two different self-supervised-learning model i.e. BYOL and SimCLR. The more details can be found at https://github.com/lucidrains/byol-pytorch/blob/master/README.md and..........

The image type in database has ten classes, i.e. blockorcircuit, chemical, drawing, flowchart, geneseq, graph, math, programm, symbol and talbe.
